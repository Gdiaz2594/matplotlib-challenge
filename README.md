Analysis
Ramicane treatment is the most promising, as the final tumor volume is the lowest of all treatment regimens having a median of Tumor Volume of 34.8486
50.7 % of the mice on this study are male
According to Mouse weight vs Avg Tumor Volume for Capomulin regimen the mouse weight tends to increase as the Tumor volume is greater
The correlation coefficient for mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen is 0.95, wich means that there is a Strong correlation between both factors
